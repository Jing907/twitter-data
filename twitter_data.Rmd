## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
twitter_data <- read.csv("HUDK4050-twitter-10-06-16.csv", header=TRUE,sep=",")
View(twitter_data)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
#plots
plot(twitter_data) #too overwhelming
plot(twitter_data$screenName,twitter_data$time) 

#create subset
D1<-twitter_data$screenName
D2<-twitter_data$time

#barplot
table<-table(D2,D1)
barplot(table)

#lineplot
plot(twitter_data$screenName, twitter_data$time, type = "l",lty = "dashed")
   #why it is not a line plot, but a boxplot instead???

#boxplot
boxplot(twitter_data$time,twitter_data$screenName)

#use of "aggregate": example of "last day of the month"
dates <- data.frame(date = as.Date("2001-01-01", format = "%Y-%m-%d") + 0:729)
last.day <- aggregate(x = dates["date"], by = list(month = substr(dates$date, 1, 7)), FUN = max)

#create a table about how many times each person tweet:) or AKA frequency table
library(plyr)
table1<-data.frame(name=twitter_data$screenName,tweet=twitter_data$text)
table2<-count(table1,"name")

```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
